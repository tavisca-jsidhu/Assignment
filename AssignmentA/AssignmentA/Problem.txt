US based travel agency Acme Travel has been hit with a high volumn of fraudulent bookings. In an effort to address this, you are required to build a
module which can identify if a booking is a potentially fraudulent booking. The agency has identified that most of the fraud bookings
have one or more of the following characterestics.

1. Customer is not the owner of the card used for the booking.
2. Booking is generally an international booking.
3. Booking amount is generally more than 1000 USD.
4. Bookings are one way bookings.
5. Bookings are made to countries whith are flagged as high fraud destinations. E.g., Nigeria, Somalia etc.
6. Travel Date is within 48 hours of booking date.
7. A lot of bookings are made within a short span of time using the same card.

Based on this behavior, the company has decided that a booking is to be marked as potential fraud in any of the following scenarios - 
a. If 2 or more than  conditions from 1,2,3,4 and 5 are satisfied.
b. If condition 4 abd 5 are true.
c. If condition 7 is true.
d. If conditions 3 and 6 are true.

These rules would be improved later as the company gets more data about the fraud behavior.

Implement the IsFraudBooking() method in the FraudChecker class to provide the desired behavior. 

The solution would be evaluated on the following criteria - 

1. Correctly solving the problem.
2. Design.
3. Maintainability.
4. Testing

Other considerations:
- Feel free to add required fields or methods to existing classes or implement new ones as required.
- In cases where you need a database, you can use an inmemory object to simulate the database. 
- Where configuration data is needed, create a constant representative test sample of your own to use.
- When in doubt, ask for help.
- Ensure your code is being committed regularly. Do not push to github untill you are ready to submit.
- All solutions must included test cases to prove that the business problem is actually solved.
